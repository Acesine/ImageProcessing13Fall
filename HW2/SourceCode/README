# Compiled on Ubuntu 13.04 with g++

# Please put all images required in these problems in the same folder with the codes.
# Please use "make -f README" to compile and run the codes
# As for matlab codes(e.g plotting histograms), please follow the instructions 
# 	printed on the screen after running the C code. 
# Note that some code in source files are commented. That's for experiments carried out
# 	just for some discussion in the report. Those may needs additional input images.

# "drawhistfromfile.m" is used to draw histogram in matlab with data from C program.
# "MyFiltering.cpp" contains functions related to filtering.
# "MyIO.cpp" contains codes about reading/writing raw images
# "README" file is a makefile
# "getVideo.m" is used to get videos in problem 1
# "givemethresholds.m" is used to get threshold used in problem 1
