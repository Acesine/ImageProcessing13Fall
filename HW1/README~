# Compiled on Ubuntu 13.04 with g++

# Please put all images required in these problems in the same folder with the codes.
# Please use "make -f README" to compile and run the codes
# As for matlab codes(e.g plotting histograms), please follow the instructions 
# 	printed on the screen after running the C code. 
# Note that some code in source files are commented. That's for experiments carried out
# 	just for some discussion in the report. Those may needs additional input images.
